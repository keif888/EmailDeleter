## Project Description

This project aims to create an IMAP client that will show you all your email folders, allow you to select one of them, and then set some filters to find emails.  
It will then allow you to delete all the found emails in batches of 10.  

## Known Issues

There is minimal error handling in place.  
It only works for Basic Authentication or Microsoft Outlook OAUTH2.  Google is mentioned, but it's not enabled.
